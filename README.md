# Social-medias-influence-on-shopping

The data I collected was based on the amount social media affects shopping.The first thing I did was go to data.world and go through the many data options. The one that stood out to me the most was "Social media's impact on shopping". From there, I downloaded the data and put it onto an excel sheet. There were originally 5 columns but after going through each one, I decided to delete the ones I found unecessary for this project. I then saved the excel sheet to my laptop and went to Jupyter. I looked through my files and found the excel sheet and uploaded it to my Jupyter notebook. I added code and made it so that only the first 10 rows of data showed. After that, I made another section of code to make a graph of my collected data. the graph I made was a bar graph showing my count and percentage.
