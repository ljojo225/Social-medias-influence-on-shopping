# Social-medias-influence-on-shopping

The data I collected was based on the amount social media affects shopping. I found a public dataset from data.world. The data has 4 categories, "Question", "Answer" , "Count" "Which App has the Most Influence", and "Result". Each category has either quantitative or qualitative answers. I found that the app that has the most influence on shopping is Instagram and then Facebook. The goal of this project is to understand which social media app has the most influence and categorize it based on gender, age, school affiliation, etc. I do not believe there are any known issues with this data but a potential bias could be bias towards the creators favorite social media app and how it affects their shopping.
